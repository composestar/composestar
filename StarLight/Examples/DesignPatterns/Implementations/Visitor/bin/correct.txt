Building the tree (1): leaves
Building the tree (1): regular nodes
The tree now looks like this: 
         regN                 
        /    \               
    regN      3               
   /    \                    
  1      2                    
collect the sum of leaf
>>> SummationVisitor collected a sum of: 6
Getting representation. Result should be {{1,2},3}.
>>> TraversalVisitor traversed the tree to: {{1,2},3}
