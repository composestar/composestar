- Replace all hashCode and equals method overrides with GetHashCode and Equals
- Convert appropriate methods into properties
- Rename DERObject to ASN1Object?
- Be careful about Substrings(2 params) -> search again at end
- Add the last two tests in EqualsAndHashCodeTest and resolve the date formatting stuff (including cms/Time)
- More date formatting stuff in x509/Time class
- Simplify string comparisons from Equals() to ==
- Consider returning IEnumeration's instead of IEnumerator to allow use of foreach by caller
- Systematically examine access specifiers -> Java's "no specifier" default should be 'internal' in C#
