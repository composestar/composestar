Instructions concerning updating of the version number

The projects will be automatically updated to reflect the current version as
set in the common.xml . However, the setup can not be automatically updated
to the new version. The following steps have to be taken:

  1. build starlight with the updated version
	2. run `ant compile_sources` in the StarLight\Setup directory
     this will build the project in "release" mode.
  3. edit the file `StarLight\Setup\Variables.wxi` and update the version
  4. create new Product and Package GUIDs for _every_ product and package
     (do not touch the upgrade code) in `StarLight\Setup\WixStarLight.wxs`
  5. run `StarLight\Setup\buildRegistration.bat`
     this will update some autogenerated wxi files
  6. open `StarLight\Setup\StarLightProject.generated.wxi` and remove the
     `Value="" Type="string"` part from the line
		 <Registry Root="HKLM" Key="Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\8.0\Generators\{d0a7707a-04e2-4aa9-a44e-89783e5bd8a8}" ... />
		 (otherwise the setup can not be build)
	7. run `ant` in the setup directory again to build the installer (note: make
	   sure the documentation has been generated)
	8. test the installer
