                Welcome to ComposeStar StarLight</h1>
            <p>
                Compose* (or ComposeStar) is a project that aims at enhancing the power of component-
                and object-based programming, so that software becomes easier to structure and modularize,
                hence easier to develop, maintain and extend.</p>
            <p>
                In particular, ComposeStar offers aspect-oriented programming (<a href="http://aosd.net">see
                    AOSD</a>) through the composition filters model (<a href="http://composestar.sf.net/">see
                        project site</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                StarLight is an implementation of ComposeStar specific for the Microsoft .NET Framework
                version 2.0. Filter code is injected into your existing assemblies based on the
                specifications and selections in the concern files.</p>
            <p>
                For more information about ComposeStar, the concern language, and more details about
                the Composition Filters approach, have a look at the <a href="http://composestar.sf.net/">

                Filters and Weaving</h3>
            <p>
                StarLight has a number of buildin filter actions, filter types and weaving strategies.
                Besides these standard items, it is also possible to create your own
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Filters.FilterTypes.FilterType">filter types</see>
                ,
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Filters.FilterTypes.FilterAction">filter actions</see>
                , and
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Weaving.Strategies.FilterActionWeaveStrategy">weaving strategies</see>
                .</p>
            <p>
                Take a look at the <a href="Filters/Filters.html">filters</a> page or the <a href="Weaving/Weaving.html">
                    weaving</a> page for more information or look for the specific types in the
                class help.</p>
            <h3 class="subHeading">
                Visual Studio Integration</h3>
            <p>
                StarLight integrates into Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and offers a project system
                to create your own <em>*.*cpsproj</em> files and a language service to enable syntax
                highlighting and IntelliSense for ComposeStar Concern (*.cps) files. See the <a href="Visual Studio Integration/Visual Studio Integration.html">
                    Visual Studio Integration</a> pages for more information.</p>
            <h3 class="subHeading">
                MSBuild</h3>
            <p>
                The StarLight weaving process consists of a number of MSBuild Tasks which are executed
                from the StarLight target file in the MSBuild folder. These tasks are responsible
                for analyzing the source files, determining the location of the filters, and the
                actual weaving of the new instructions. For more information about the MSBuild process,
                visit the help pages about <a href="MSBuild/MSBuild.html">MSBuild</a>.</p>
