                What is Strong Naming
            </h1>
            <p>
                Microsoft's Strong Naming facilities let you, at build time, or shortly after, sign
                assemblies. This has several consequences:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assemblies can verify that libraries are signed by the appropriate vendor. Even
                        more important you can verify the assembly you are using is exactly the one you
                        think you are using and that it's not a different version and that it hasn't been
                        tampered with.</li>
                    <li>Some degree of temperproofing. All strong named assemblies have the signature and
                        associated public key tacked on to the end of the assembly and the .NET runtime
                        will validate that these match. There are ways around this but it raises the bar.</li>
                    <li>Libraries can even verify that callers are signed by a particular key. So vendors
                        can build libraries that can only be used by their applications.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                When an assembly is strongly named the process is something like this:<ul>
                    <li>A unique hash is generated for the assembly based on the file contents</li>
                    <li>The unique hash is signed using the supplied key file</li>
                    <li>The signature + public key are appended to the assembly</li></ul>
                Now when loading a strongly named assembly the .NET runtime checks the signature
                on the assembly using the public key that is embedded in the assembly. Assuming
                the signature and public key are left intact, any tampering to the assembly will
                become evident. However, one can simple tamper with the assembly and resign using
                a new key and attach that in place of the existing.
