                Weaving Strategies</h1>
            <p>
                The weaving model determines, at a high level, what type of code has to be generated.
                The IL weaver is reponsible for generation the correct IL statements like creating
                branches, jumps, conditions, calls, and so on. A visitor design pattern is used
                to accomplish this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Filter Action code however is handled by dedicated weaving strategies. The default
                <a href="../Filters/FilterActions.html">Filter Actions</a> have each a buildin weaving
                strategy which determines what type of IL code has to be generated.<br />
                These buildin weaving strategies can be found in the <strong><em>StarLight installation
                    folder</em>/WeaveStrategies</strong> folder.</p>
            <p>
                If there is no weaving strategy for a Filter Action, the
                <see cref="M:Composestar.StarLight.Filters.FilterTypes.FilterAction.Execute(Composestar.StarLight.ContextInfo.JoinPointContext)">Execute</see>
                method will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have created your own Filter Action and do not want to use the
                <see cref="M:Composestar.StarLight.Filters.FilterTypes.FilterAction.Execute(Composestar.StarLight.ContextInfo.JoinPointContext)">Execute</see>
                method, you can <a href="createownweavingstrategy.html">create your own weaving strategy</a>.</p>
