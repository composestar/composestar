            <p>
                The StarLight IL weaver performs code injection at the IL level. The weaver adds
                IL instructions, the filter actions and some management functions, at the start
                of a method and it can replace calls with outputfilters. Besides the methods, it
                adds internals and externals to a type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Code injection is only performed when the analysis tools indicate that the weaver
                has to generate code for a certain type or method. Methods with no filter actions
                are left untouchted by the StarLight weaver.</p>
            <p>
                The IL Weaver uses the weave specification file to determine where and what to weave
                in a given assembly. The filter code is an abstract model and the weaver uses an
                internal visitor to visit each element in the model so IL code can be generated.</p>
            <p>
                Code generation for <a href="../Filters/FilterActions.html">Filter Actions</a>
                is handled by <a href="weavingstrategies.html">weaving strategies</a> and it is
                possible to <a href="createownweavingstrategy.html">create your own weaving strategy</a>
                if you want to emit specific IL code for a certain filter action.</p>
