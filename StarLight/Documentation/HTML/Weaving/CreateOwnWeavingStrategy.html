                and do not want to use the
                <see cref="M:Composestar.StarLight.Filters.FilterTypes.FilterAction.Execute(Composestar.StarLight.ContextInfo.JoinPointContext)">Execute</see>
                method of the Filter Action, then create your own weaving strategy. This gives you
                direct control over the emitted IL code, but introduces a more complex model to
                inject code into assemblies.

                How to create a weave strategy</h3>
            <p>
                A custom weave strategy is basically a type implementing the
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Weaving.Strategies.FilterActionWeaveStrategy">FilterActionWeaveStrategy</see>
                . Besides the inheritance, you also have to add a
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Weaving.Strategies.WeaveStrategyAttribute">WeaveStrategyAttribute</see>
                to the class so it can be discovered and added to the weaving strategies by the
                IL Weaver.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step is to add your weave strategy to the list of strategies used by the
                weaver. Place your assembly containing the weave strategy implementation in the
                <strong><em>StarLight installation folder</em>/WeaveStrategies</strong> folder.
                When the IL weaver is started for the first time, it will read all the assemblies
                in this folder, looks for the WeaveStrategyAttribute, and add the found strategies
                to the list.</p>
            <p>
                To help you in your development of a custom weave strategy, you can use the
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Weaving.Strategies.WeaveStrategyUtilities">WeaveStrategyUtilities</see>
                , the
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.Utilities.CecilUtilities">CecilUtilities</see>
                , and
                <see cref="T:Composestar.StarLight.ContextInfo.JoinPointContext">JoinPointContext</see>
                classes during the development.
            </p>
            <p>
                The WeaveStrategyUtilities contains functionality to work with arguments and Join
                Points, the CecilUtilities has functions to resolve methods and types from assemblies
                so they can be used in your code.</p>
