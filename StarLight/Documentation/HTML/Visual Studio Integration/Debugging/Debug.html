                Debugging of woven files</h1>
            <p>
                The StarLight IL weaver updates existing debug files (PDB) by rewriting the sequence
                points and documents from the original debug file and hides the injected code. Debugging
                the woven code is no different then debugging your original program because the
                extra added filter code is hidden for the debugger.</p>
            <p>
                The woven file and new PDB file are located in the <i>bin</i> folder of your concerns
                project. There are a number of ways to use debugging:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Copy the woven assembly and PDB file to the output folder of your original project.
                    You can do this manually or use a <a href="../../MSBuild/ExtendingMSBuild.html">postbuild
                        target</a> like the <i>AfterWeave</i>. In this MSBuild target, use a copy task
                    to copy the woven files and PDB back to your project folder.</li>
                <li>In the properties of your source project, select the <i>Debug</i> tab and select
                    the option <i>Start external program</i>. Browse for the executable in the concern
                    project output folder.</li>
                <li>Attach the Visual Studio debugger to an instance of the application. Start the woven
                    application, select <i>Debug</i>,<i>Attach to Process...</i> from the menu and pick
                    your running application from the list.</li>
                <li>Use the <i>CORDBG</i> located in the .NET SDK folder or the <i>DbgCLR</i> for a
                    GUI version of the debugger.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;the debugger will skip filter code, meaning a number of actions can occur which cannot be seen in the debugger.</p>
