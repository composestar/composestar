            <p>
                MSBuild is used to control the compilation and weaving process for the StarLight
                projects. By altering your <em>cpsproj</em> file or the StarLight.targets file you
                can change this process.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to interface with a number of targets, which can be overriden in
                your own <em>cpsproj</em> project file:</p>
            <table class="members" id="tasks">
                <tr>
                    <th class="nameColumn">
                        Target name</th>
                    <th class="descriptionColumn">
                        Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <b><span class="nolink">BeforeWeave</span></b></td>
                    <td>
                        <div class="summary">
                            Called before the actual weaving tasks are started. Also before any compilation
                            of code inside the Concern project.
                        </div>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                            Called when the weave tasks are completed. This can, for instance, be used to copy
                            the outputs to another folder.

                    </td>

                Besides the targets above, you can also use or override the default targets like
                <em>BeforeBuild</em>, <em>AfterBuild</em>, and so on. See the MSDN for more information
                about <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms366724.aspx">extending the
                    Visual Studio Build process</a>.</p>

                Compile concern project by compiling source project</h3>
            <p>
                Normally, you build the concern project. This will build all the dependent projects
                and perform the weaving. This will leave the original project untouched. If you
                want to build the concern project when you are building your original source project,
                then you have to edit your project file to build the concern project.</p>
            <p>
                For example; you have a source project called <b>S</b> and a concern project called
                <b>C</b>. Normally, you build project <b>S</b> so you get a version without weaved
                code, or you build project <b>C</b>, which first build project <b>S</b>, copies
                the output to the bin folder of project <b>C</b> and performs the weaving.</p>
            <p>
                It is possible to build project <b>C</b> automatically when you build project <b>S</b>
                by changing the project file of <b>S</b>. Add a new target called <em>AfterBuild</em>
                to the project and add the <em>MSBuild</em> task to this target. Set the properties
                of the MSBuild task to the concern project <b>C</b>. After each build, the concern
                project is being build. If you want to copy the weaved output files to the non-weaved
                output files, include a copy action in the target. This can be usefull when you
                want to change the runnable file to a runnable file with weaved filters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The compilation performed by the concern project is incremental,
                so the source will not be recompiled.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b>&nbsp;You can add a condition to the <em>AfterBuild</em> target. Use
                for instance the <em>Configuration</em> value and define new configurations like
                <em>ConcernsDebug</em> and <em>ConcernsRelease</em> in addition to the existing
                <em>Debug</em> and <em>Release</em> configurations. The concern project can make
                use of these configuration to perform certain operations in specific cases.</p>
