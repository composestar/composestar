                MSBuild</h1>
            <p>
                The StarLight project uses the Microsoft Build system to perform the analysis and
                weaving of the concern code. The <em>cpsproj</em> file for a StarLight Concern project
                consists of a number of tasks controlling the compilation and weaving. You can start
                MSBuild by either running MSBuild (located in your .NET framework folder) with the
                name of the <em>cpsproj</em> file, or use the <b>Build</b> option in Visual Studio
                on the Concern project.</p>
            <p>
                For instance, to weave a Concern project named <em>Tracing.cpsproj</em>, execute
                the following command from the command line:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>MSBuild Tracing.cpsproj</pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                A special <em>Weave</em> target is being called as the default target. To clean
                and weave the project, use the following construction:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>MSBuild Tracing.cpsproj /t:reweave</pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                The <em>cpsproj</em> file contains an import of the <b>StarLight.targets</b> file,
                located in the MSBuild folder under the Program Files folder. This target file contains
                the tasks definitions and controls the compilation and weaving. It will build the
                referenced projects first, copy the output to the bin folder of the concern project,
                and starts the analyzer and weaver.</p>
            <p>
