This serves as the central project in the solution. 
It does not contain any source files, but has dependencies to all other projects.
Therefore the target files (dll's) of all projects are copied to the output folder of this one (obj/Debug or obj/Release).
This project can be removed once the ANT build system has been updated for VS2005.
