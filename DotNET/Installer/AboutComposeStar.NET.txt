Welcome to the 'M.C. Escher' 0.6 maintance release of Compose*.NET.

Please visit [http://composestar.sourceforge.net/] for more information.

Compose* (or: ComposeStar) is a project that aims at enhancing the power of component- and object-based programming, so that software becomes easier to structure and modularize, hence easier to develop, maintain and extend. In particular, Compose* offers aspect-oriented programming (http://aosd.net) through the composition filters model (http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/composition_filters).

New in Compose*.NET 0.6
* Preliminary support for Debugging filters
* A lot of bug fixes
* A completely rewrite of the plug-in to prepare for the introduction of Compose*/Java and Compose*/C
* A complete restructuring of the source code to prepare for the introduction of Compose*/Java and Compose*/C
* Incremental compilation is completed to a large extend

!!!Important!!!
* You should be at least a Windows Power User on your system in order to install Compose*.
* Compose* is not (yet) compatible with Visual Studio 2005 or the Microsoft .NET framework 2.
* There are some localization issues, i.e. Compose* will NOT run on a German localized version of Visual Studio.

This Compose*.NET requires:
 * Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 or higher [http://java.sun.com/]
 * Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
 * Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 (included with Visual Studio .NET 2003) [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/]
