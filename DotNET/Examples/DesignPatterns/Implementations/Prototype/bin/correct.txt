Testing the Prototype design pattern implementation...
These are the two prototypes:
StringPrototypeA:   This is Prototype 1
StringPrototypeB:   This is Prototype 2
These are copies of the prototypes:
StringPrototypeA:   This is Prototype 1
StringPrototypeB:   This is Prototype 2
Now prototype 1 is changed. Here are prototype 1 and its former copy:
StringPrototypeA:   This is Prototype 1 (changed)
StringPrototypeA:   This is Prototype 1
This is a clone of the changed prototype 1 and a changed copy of prototype 2:
StringPrototypeA:   This is Prototype 1 (changed)
StringPrototypeB:   This is a changed copy of prototype 2
... done.
