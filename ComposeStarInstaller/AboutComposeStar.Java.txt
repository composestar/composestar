Welcome to the 'Rembrandt' maintenance release of Compose*.Java.

Please visit [http://composestar.sourceforge.net/] for more information.

Compose* (or: ComposeStar) is a project that aims at enhancing the power of component- and object-based programming, so that software becomes easier to structure and modularize, hence easier to develop, maintain and extend. In particular, Compose* offers aspect-oriented programming (http://aosd.net) through the composition filters model (http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/composition_filters).

This Compose*/Java requires:
 * Java Development Kit 1.4.2 or higher [http://java.sun.com/]
 * Eclipse version 3.0 or higher [http://www.eclipse.org]

Compose* is licensed under LGPL v2.1 or (at your option) any later version.
