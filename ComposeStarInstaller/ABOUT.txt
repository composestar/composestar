Welcome to the 'Mondriaan' release of Compose*.

Please visit [http://composestar.sourceforge.net/] for more information.

Compose* (or: ComposeStar) is a project that aims at enhancing the power of component- and object-based programming, so that software becomes easier to structure and modularize, hence easier to develop, maintain and extend. In particular, Compose* offers aspect-oriented programming (http://aosd.net) through the composition filters model (http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/composition_filters).
