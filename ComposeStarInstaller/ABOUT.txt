This is the first public beta release of the Compose* project [http://composestar.sf.net]. 

Compose* (or: ComposeStar) is a project that aims at enhancing the power of component- and object-based programming, so that software becomes easier to structure and modularize, hence easier to develop, maintain and extend. In particular, Compose* offers aspect-oriented programming (http://aosd.net) through the composition filters model (http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/composition_filters).

This Compose* beta requires:
 * Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 or higher [http://java.sun.com/]
 * Microsoft .NET Framework Version 1.1 [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/]
 * Microsoft .NET Framework Software Development Kit Version 1.1 (Included with Visual Studio .NET) [http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/]
	
For more information about using the Compose* tool please see the included README.html file.

Compose* is licensed under LGPL v2.1 or (at your option) any later version.
