The problems when Marying.

This program shows how to debug complex composition filter programs.

The unfiltered programm is a program with just 2 persons.
These persons try to mary each other.
When run without filters this is a quite comprehensible program.

When the concerns Law, Money, and Party are combined to the program are combined with the program. The complete flow becomes a mess and is difficult to understand.

To see how the flow happens, copy the debugger.xml to the bin directory and rerun the program.
