The new build configuration format has been split up into two sections:
	- project build configuration
	- platform configuration
	
The project build configuration only contains information important for
the current project. The platform configuration is something that is 
common amongst all projects that share the same platform, there is no
need to repeat this information for every platform.

The build configuration describes all details about the project. It 
contains three sections:
	- compiler settings
	- project description
	- filter definitions
The compiler settings are used to override the default parameters. 
These settings could be considered as global settings and not project
specific. The same settings section could be shared by several 
projects.
The project description contains an overview of the project's sources, 
concern sources, dependencies and additional resources. Additional
resources are files that are required by the compiled program but are
not required during the compilation process. For example image files.
These files will be copied to the output directory on a successful 
compilation. The project also contains some attributes that define the
platform, base directory and used programming language. The paths
used in this section may be relative paths. In this case they will be
resolved using the project's base directory. The project's base 
directory may also be a relative path, it will then be resolved to an
absolute path using the current working directory.
The third section is used to provide filter information like custom
filters or filter type and action declarations. The usage of this block
depends on the platform. It can be omitted if the platform has other
methods to get a hold on this information. Relative paths used in this
section will also be resolved using the project's base directory.

Two configuration files:
  - build configuration for projects
  - platform configurations for the various platforms
